Source code management (SCM) lifecycle, also known as version control lifecycle, is the process through which software projects manage the creation, storage, and modification of source code files in a collaborative environment. It typically consists of several stages, each serving a specific purpose in the development process. Here's an overview of the SCM lifecycle stages along with examples for each stage:

1. Creation Stage:
   - Purpose: This stage involves the initial creation of a new software project or feature branch. Developers begin by creating a new repository or branching off from an existing one to start working on a new feature.
   - Example: Suppose a team of developers is tasked with adding a new authentication module to an existing web application. They create a new feature branch named "auth-module" in the main repository to work on this feature.

2. Development Stage:
   - Purpose: In this stage, developers actively write and modify source code to implement new features, fix bugs, or make improvements. Collaboration among team members is essential, and changes are frequently pushed to the shared repository.
   - Example: Developers working on the authentication module write code to handle user registration, login, and session management. They regularly commit their changes to the "auth-module" branch, integrating their work with changes from other team members.

3. Testing Stage:
   - Purpose: After development, code changes undergo testing to ensure they meet functional requirements, performance standards, and do not introduce regressions. Testing may include unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
   - Example: Testers review the authentication module functionality, verifying that users can register, log in, and access protected resources securely. Automated tests are run to validate the behavior of the module under various scenarios.

4. Review Stage:
   - Purpose: This stage involves peer code reviews where team members inspect the code changes for quality, correctness, and adherence to coding standards. Reviews help identify potential issues early in the development process.
   - Example: Developers submit pull requests or merge requests for their code changes to be reviewed by their peers. Reviewers provide feedback on the implementation, suggesting improvements or identifying potential bugs.

5. Deployment Stage:
   - Purpose: Once code changes have been tested and reviewed, they are ready to be deployed to production or staging environments. Deployment involves packaging the code, configuring servers, and ensuring a smooth transition from development to production.
   - Example: The authentication module is deployed to the staging environment, allowing stakeholders to perform final acceptance testing before releasing it to production. Deployment scripts automate the process of installing and configuring the module on servers.

6. Maintenance Stage:
   - Purpose: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where developers continue to monitor, maintain, and support the application. This stage includes addressing bug fixes, security patches, and implementing feature enhancements.
   - Example: Following deployment, developers receive bug reports related to the authentication module. They diagnose and fix issues promptly, releasing patches to address any identified vulnerabilities or performance issues.
